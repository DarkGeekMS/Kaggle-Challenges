# Kaggle Challenges

## Introduction:

This repository contains the notebooks that I worked on for some Kaggle challenges.

The notebook contains the code for the preprocessing, model building and postprocessing steps, assuming you have the dataset locally you can start training the model.

## Some Details:

I'm using Python 3, along with some frameworks and packages, suck as:

- Tensorflow.
- Keras.
- Pytorch.
- sklearn.

At the top of each notebook, a link to the competition is found.
